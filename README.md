# Gallery-project

There is a full screen background image with a thumbnail gallery in the top left corner and 2 buttons on screen which change the current image on display
The thumbnail gallery and buttons change opacity based on user input which is controlled by javascript and mouse over inputs
The buttons utilise javascript to change the current index to change the current background image
The image thumbnails in the gallery will display a text on mouseover which gives a brief description of that image
The buttons will give a description of what they do on mouse over
Each image in the thumbnail gallery is also a button that will set the background image to that image which was something that took me a lot of time to figure out

I really struggled to figure out how to implement a way to navigate through the gallery using the arrow keys

A bit more time with javascript (or just more practise in general) would make this easier for me but considering the experience I have at the moment I am very happy with the outcome
